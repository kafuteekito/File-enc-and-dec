File Compression and Decompression

There's used Run-length encoding (RLE), it is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run.
For example, if the input string is “wwwwaaadexxxxxx”, then the function should return “w4a3d1e1x6”.

To run this programm, write the text into "input.txt" file, either you want to encrypt it or decrypt, then run the code and choose 1 if you want to encrypt it and 2 if you want to decrypt it. The result will be in "output.txt" file.
